Forget the excuses and say goodbye to being marked as ‚ÄúAway‚Äù in your corporate messenger app.

This marvelous piece of software works its magic by moving your mouse cursor around randomly, giving the illusion that you are intensely focused on _something_ important while in reality, you're just debating whether pineapple belongs on pizza.

4. **Hit Start**: Click that button and watch your mouse wiggle as if it's been fed a can of energy drinks.
5. **Interact (Optional)**: If you feel compelled to actually work, you can simply move your mouse or even use the _Stop_ button.

## Warning

While Move My Mouse To Hide can help keep your status green, use it responsibly! You might just be working towards that long-deserved promotion‚Äîor avoiding your boss's gaze when they ask, "What are you working on?"

So go ahead, thrive in the realm of "active" status and keep your "Out of Office" card at bay. Because let‚Äôs face it, there‚Äôs a world of distractions out there, and your status shouldn‚Äôt be one of them!

**May your status always be "Active!"** üï∫üíª‚ú®‚úÖ

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that the following software is installed on your computer:

### Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     export CLASSPATH=/path/to/your/java/bin
     ```

4. **Verify Installation**: Check that Java is installed by running:
